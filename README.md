# AdventureWorks Sales Data

## Overview
This is a report built following [Ali Ahmad's Data Analyst Porfolio Project](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMfXakCUhXsEUtk8c0zWr4whamGxLhAu0).

Although I followed the series to build the report, I added my own extra touches to the report such as using a DAX built calendar (to showcase my DAX skills), and adding two drillthrough dashboards for Customers and Products.

## Task
Analyze Internet Sales from the AdventureWorks sample database using a provided (fake) budget.
